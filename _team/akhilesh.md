I am a Natural Language Processing (NLP) Researcher primarily interested in low-resource languages. I have previously worked on building language technologies (and products) such as Machine Translation Systems, Voice assistants, Multilingual Chatbots, Corpus linguistics, and so on. This has helped me work in diverse environments ranging from Governments to early-level startups.
