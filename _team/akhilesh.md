I am a Natural Language Processing (NLP) Researcher primarily interested in low-resource languages. I have previously worked on building language technologies (and products) such as Machine Translation Systems, Voice assistants, Multilingual Chatbots, Corpus linguistics, and so on. I have the experience of working in diverse environments ranging from Governments to early level startups.
