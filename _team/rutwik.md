I am a development professional with 6+ years of experience of working in Northeast India. I am an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Management, Shillong. Besides working as a Prime Minister's Rural Development Fellow and thereafter in a World Bank Project, I also head a non-profit organization named TREE Foundation. I have been instrumental in planning and implementing educational projects in the States of Meghalaya, Assam, Chhattisgarh and Arunachal Pradesh. Being an author and a poet himself, I have a keen interest in languages.
